\subsection{Methods used for User Experience Evaluation}
AttrakDiff is a questionare which contains in total 21 pairwise contradictory questions, of which 7 are pragmatic and 14 hedonistic. It assists in understanding what users think about the usability and design of a given product. For our UX evaluation we used a variation of Attrakdiff provided by Attrakdiff.de \footnote{http://attrakdiff.de/index-en.html$\#$trial}, which we adapted by only including the questions we found most relevant for our domain. This resulted in 22 questions which we translated to Danish, as the participants were Danish and we worried that they may not understand the questions in English. The questions can be seen in \autoref{appendix:questionare}.

The other method used was co-discovery, which is a lab study including two participants, who work well together solving assignments for the system while being either moderated and/or recorded. We used the method by having one of us as moderator and the other taking notes. \bjarke{the partisipants are expected to think aloud}
