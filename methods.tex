Here we will describe the two methods used for the User Experience (UX) evaluation of Amazon.co.uk: Attrakdiff and Co-discovery.
Attrakdiff is a questionare which contains in total 21 pairwise contradictory questions, of which 7 are pragmatic and 14 hedonistic. It assists in understanding what users think about the usability and design of a given product. For our UX evaluation we used a variation of Attrakdiff provided by Attrakdiff.de \footnote{http://attrakdiff.de/index-en.html$\#$trial}, which we adapted by only including the questions we found most relevant for our domain. This resulted in 22 questions which we translated to Danish, as the participants were Danes and we worried that they may not understand the questions in English. The questions can be seen in \autoref{appendix:questionare}.

The other method used was Co-discovery, which is a lab study including two participants, who work well together. The lab study is usually moderated and/or recorded, while the the participants are expected to think aloud. When using the method we have one of us acting as moderator and the other taking notes.
