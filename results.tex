\subsection{Results for Co-discovery}
The functionality primarily used while trying to solve the assignments was the main search bar, located at the top center, see the red square in \autoref{results:amazonsearchbar}, and the sorting function of the found results for a given search, sorted primarily by price, see the red square in \autoref{results:amazonsortby}.

The functionality that we considered useful, and expected to be used, included the recommender system, and the category drop-down menu in the top left corner, which were never utilized, see the blue square in \autoref{results:amazonsearchbar} and the red square in \bjarke{inserted picture of recommender system}. Also the participants became rather confused when trying to find the relevant information regarding shipping of a certain product.

\subsection{Results for AttrakDiff}
From the results of the AttrakDiff questionare we observed that the participants agreed that the system was
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple
\item Easy to use
\item Practical
\item Professional
\end{itemize}
...We suspect this is because assignments could easily be solved using the just the search bar, \bjarke{explain why we think this is: } \\
However they didn't find it especially:
\begin{itemize}
\item Social
\item Innovative
\item Creative
\item New
\end{itemize}
This is likely because the purpose of the system is by large pragmatic...\bjarke{explain why we think this is}
